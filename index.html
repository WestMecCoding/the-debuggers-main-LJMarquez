        <p><u>Founding Story</u><br>
          Since 2050, Borcelle® Coffee Roastery was established by a group of coffee
          aficionados and culinary experts who shared a passion for quality, wealth,
          nostalgia, and fitness. They recognizd a growing demand for plant-based
          options and a yearning for a throwback finest dining experience, leading them to create
          a cafe where these elements harmoniously blend. Led by seasoned baristo Johnny Dang, 
          along with the talents of roaster Leo Marquez, and his wife branding expert Emily Marquez, 
          logistics wizard Luis Torres, coffee expert Andrei Buhatin, and our chairman Ethan McNauhton Borcelle® cafe was born. Their journey took them across 
          Mexico and China to source the finest beans, emphasizing ethical and sustainable practices. 
          Through dedication and perseverance, the team overcame challenges to establish 
          a charming coffee haven. Borcelle® Company not only delighted the senses with 
          meticulously roasted coffee but also fostered a community around a shared 
          appreciation for quality and sustainability, making it a beloved 
          cornerstone in the organization's culture.
