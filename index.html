          <u>Founding Story</u><br />
          Since 2020, Borcelle® Coffee Roastery was established by a group of
          coffee aficionados and culinary experts who shared a passion for
          quality, wealth, nostalgia, and fitness. They recognizd a growing
          demand for plant-based options and a yearning for a throwback finest
          dining experience, leading them to create a cafe where these elements
          harmoniously blend. Led by seasoned baristo Johnny Dang, along with
          the talents of roaster Leo Marquez, and his wife branding expert Emily
          Marquez, logistics wizard Luis Torres, coffee expert Andrei Buhatin,
          and our chairman Ethan McNauhton Borcelle® cafe was born. Their
          journey took them across Mexico and China to source the finest beans,
          emphasizing ethical and sustainable practices. Through dedication and
          perseverance, the team overcame challenges to establish a charming
          coffee haven. Borcelle® Company not only delighted the senses with
          meticulously roasted coffee but also fostered a community around a
          shared appreciation for quality and sustainability, making it a
          beloved cornerstone in the organization's culture.
